# Introduction to GitHub Codespaces

Welcome to the world of GitHub Codespaces—your gateway to cloud-based coding. In this module, we’ll explore the transformative power of instant, cloud-hosted development environments that redefine how you approach coding. GitHub Codespaces offers a seamless, integrated experience, providing a fully equipped container with all the essential languages, tools, and utilities you need to code effectively.

As we navigate this learning journey, you’ll discover the complete Codespaces lifecycle and gain insights into customizing your setup to match your specific preferences and requirements. To reinforce your understanding, the module concludes with a hands-on exercise where you’ll get to apply your skills directly within the GitHub Codespaces environment.

Picture a fully configured development setup, ready to use and accessible from any computer with an internet connection. GitHub Codespaces empowers you to embrace a new era of collaborative, flexible coding. Let’s dive in and unlock the full potential of cloud-based development together!!

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions?WT.mc_id=academic-113596-abartolo).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
