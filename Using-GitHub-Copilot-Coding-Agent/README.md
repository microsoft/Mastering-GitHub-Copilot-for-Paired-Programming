# Using GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

Welcome to a hands-on, multi-section module focused on the **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** — an autonomous AI developer that works independently in the background to complete tasks across the full software delivery lifecycle. Unlike IDE-based assistant features, the coding agent operates on GitHub itself, handling everything from branch creation and code changes to pull request authoring and iterative review cycles.

This module walks through every major capability of the coding agent available today, giving you practical experience with each feature in a real workflow.

---

- **Who this is for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, Engineering Managers, Platform Engineers, and anyone who wants to scale their team's output with AI.
- **What you'll learn**: How to assign tasks, track sessions, steer Copilot's work, customize agent behavior, integrate MCP servers, and manage security — all within a GitHub-native workflow.
- **What you'll build**: A hands-on understanding of Copilot coding agent across the complete software delivery lifecycle: planning → coding → testing → review → merge.
- **Prerequisites**: GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan. [Sign up for GitHub Copilot](https://gh.io/copilot).
- **Timing**: This module can be completed in approximately 60–90 minutes.

By the end of this module, you'll acquire the skills to:

- Assign GitHub issues and pull requests to Copilot as a coding resource.
- Track, steer, and stop Copilot agent sessions from multiple surfaces.
- Review and iterate on Copilot-generated pull requests.
- Customize agent behavior with instructions, agent profiles, MCP servers, hooks, and skills.
- Use Copilot to address security alerts at scale with security campaigns.
- Integrate the coding agent into IDEs, the GitHub CLI, Raycast, and mobile tools.
